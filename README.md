## UnownRoller helps you play Pok√©role on Discord
### How do I use this?

I think I've done a decent job describing how UnownRoller works in its internal `/help` documentation.

Besides that, I don't have anything written out for dedicated hosting yet - currently it's run from my IDE whenever I want to use it.

Feel free to contact me on Discord under `Leah#0004` if you're interested.

UnownRoller uses [py-rolldice](https://pypi.org/project/py-rolldice/) to facilitate randomization and rolling.
